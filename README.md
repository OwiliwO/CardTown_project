"Greetings, traveler. You have seen many adventures over the years and now, in a tavern at the edge of the universe, you have been given a well-deserved rest. But why not make the most of this time and play a game....." - An old stranger.

## Description
Welcome to CardTown - a fantasy card game where your goal is to build a thriving settlement in a mysterious world at the edge of the universe.
In this game, every minute is worth 1 gold coin. You have at your disposal a field of 18 cards, on each of which you can erect a building for a certain fee. Each building holds a certain number of inhabitants, and some have special properties that affect the game (but these properties must be paid for daily).

Every day in CardTown there is event that can be both a blessing and a curse:
- Events can be negative (рdestruction of buildings, loss of inhabitants or gold)
- Or positive (safe passage, unexpected help)
- The fate of your settlement depends on how you prepare for these events
- Standart - reach a certain number of inhabitants in your settlement. A classic challenge for true kingdom builders.
- Infinity - a mode with no specific goal - build, evolve and see how far you can go in your quest for greatness.
- Gold Fever - your goal is to build a certain number of mines. Try your luck in search of untold riches.
- Dragonfight - reduce the chance of a Dragon Attack event to zero. Protect your kingdom from the fire threat.

Each building in CardTown has its own unique magic and properties.
- Simple Shack - accommodates a small number of residents. The basis of any start-up settlement.
- Sanctuary - increases the chance of the event “Blessing of the Goddess of Love”. A place of spiritual power and harmony.
- Townhall - increases the chance of the “Price Indexing” event and gives a daily increase in residents. The heart of your settlement.

The events of CardTown are unpredictable twists of fate that can elevate your kingdom to glory or plunge it into chaos.
- Angel's Promise - guarantees that the next 2 days will be uneventful. A rare moment of calm in a tumultuous world.
- Dragon Attack - a fire dragon destroys some of your structures. Prepare your defenses in advance!
- The Treasure of the Deep Mines - grants a significant amount of gold coins. Luck has smiled upon you!
- The Curse of the Coastlands - casts a curse on a certain number of cards, rendering them useless for a time.
- The blessing of the Goddess of Love - increases the number of residents and improves the mood of the settlement.
- Goblin Invasion - thieves are stealing some of your gold. Fortify your defenses!

In a tavern at the edge of the universe, an old stranger holds out a deck of cards to you. Your journey into the world of CardTown begins now. What kingdom will you build? What challenges will you overcome? And what legend will you leave behind? The fate of your settlement is in your hands, traveler. Grab your maps and start building your story...
